Santos, who was employed from June 2021 to September 2023, alleges her termination was in retaliation for union organizing activities. The company firmly denies these claims and maintains that the decision was based solely on documented performance issues.\n\nOver the course of her employment, Santos received three formal performance warnings: the first in November 2022 for repeated delays in order fulfillment, resulting in a 15% drop in her team's processing efficiency; the second in March 2023 for safety protocol violations, including improper handling of equipment that led to a minor inventory damage incident valued at $2,500; and the third in July 2023 for absenteeism, with 12 unexcused absences in a six-month period. These issues were addressed through our standard progressive discipline process, which includes documented coaching sessions and performance improvement plans. Despite these efforts, performance did not improve, leading to her termination on September 10, 2023.\n\nFairfield Logistics respects employees' rights to engage in protected activities, including union organizing, and has a track record of compliance: In the past five years, we've resolved 100% of employee concerns through internal mediation without external escalation. We are fully cooperating with the NLRB investigation and are confident it will confirm our actions were lawful and unrelated to any union efforts. To date, this is an isolated complaint affecting one individual, with potential remedies limited to back pay estimated at $15,000 and possible reinstatement, which we will address through the process.\n\nOur 1,200 employees are our greatest asset, and we maintain high standards with an 85% employee satisfaction rate from our annual anonymous survey conducted in August 2023.
