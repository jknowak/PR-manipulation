Our chemical plant, located 10 miles upstream, has been operational for 15 years with a strong record of environmental compliance, but we take these reports extremely seriously and are committed to addressing them head-on.\n\nFollowing the initial reports on October 10, we immediately halted all discharge operations at the plant within 24 hours and initiated an internal investigation. Independent water samples collected on October 11 showed trace levels of industrial solvents at 0.5 parts per million—below federal safety thresholds—but we are not dismissing any potential link. We have deployed a team of 20 environmental experts to conduct daily monitoring along a 15-mile stretch of the river, with preliminary results expected by October 20. Additionally, we are providing $500,000 in immediate funding to local health clinics for water testing and medical support for affected families, including the hospitalized children.\n\nGreenChem is cooperating fully with the state environmental agency's inquiry and welcomes the congressional review. We have shared all operational data from the past six months, including effluent logs and safety audits, to ensure a thorough examination.
